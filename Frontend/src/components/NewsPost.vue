    <h3>Rubber Ducks in Pinehill</h3>
    <p>
      Residents of Pinehill Heights woke up to a bizarre scene this morning when a four-meter-tall inflatable rubber duck was spotted drifting slowly down Birch Avenue, causing traffic delays and widespread confusion. Witnesses described the duck as “eerily calm” and “judging everyone silently.” Commuters were forced to navigate around the giant yellow obstruction while local children cheered it on from sidewalks. “At first, I thought it was a hallucination,” said longtime resident Mr. Daniels, “but then it honked. I don’t even know how.”

      The inflatable duck, now affectionately named Quackson by locals, is believed to have been part of a marketing stunt gone wrong or an elaborate neighborhood prank. Some speculate it was launched as part of the viral *Pinehill Pranks 2025* challenge on TikTok. For now, Quackson has been tied securely to a streetlamp and is being closely monitored by 11-year-old Timmy Jacobs, who insists it's his pet. The City Council has yet to comment on the situation, but Quackson already has over 5,000 followers on Instagram under the handle <strong>@QuacksonOfficial</strong>.
